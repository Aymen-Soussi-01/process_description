Naming Conventions of Files
---------------------------

The overall naming convention is to use snake case for all files and folders (all files are named lowercase and spaces are replaced by underscores).

.. _Platform_Folder_Structure:

Folder Structure of Platform Repository
---------------------------------------

The following shows the folder structure of the platform repository (ordered alphabetically). The ordering of the documentation in the rendered documentation
can be in a different order.
